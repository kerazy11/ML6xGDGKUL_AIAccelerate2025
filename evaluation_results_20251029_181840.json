      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u00c8\u203acu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "Let's break down the logic of the situation:\n\n1.  **The Statement:** Everyone in the village says, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n2.  **The Rules:** Humans always tell the truth; vampires always lie.\n\nNow, let's consider two possibilities for the truthfulness of the statement:\n\n**Possibility 1: The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is TRUE.**\n*   If the statement is true, it means there is at least one human in the village.\n*   If a human says this statement, they are telling the truth, which is consistent.\n*   If a vampire says this statement, they are also telling the truth. However, vampires *always* lie. This creates a contradiction.\n*   Therefore, if the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is true, no vampire could have said it. But we know everyone (including the vampire you spotted) made this statement. This possibility leads to a contradiction with the known vampire.\n\n**Possibility 2: The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is FALSE.**\n*   If the statement is false, it means \"None of us are human,\" or in other words, \"All of us are vampires.\"\n*   If a human says this statement, they are lying. However, humans *always* tell the truth. This creates a contradiction.\n*   If a vampire says this statement, they are lying. This is perfectly consistent with vampires always lying.\n\nSince everyone in the village, including the known vampire, made the same statement, and only vampires can lie consistently when the statement is false, the only logical conclusion is that:\n\n*   The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" must be false.\n*   If the statement is false, it means everyone in the village is a vampire.\n*   Since the statement is false, and everyone said it, it implies that everyone is lying, which means everyone must be a vampire.\n\nTherefore, all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires.",

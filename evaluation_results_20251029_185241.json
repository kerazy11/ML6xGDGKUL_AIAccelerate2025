      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u00c8\u203acu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "This is a classic logic puzzle. Let's analyze the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" given by all 100 residents:\n\n1.  **Consider the possibility that there is at least one human in the village.**\n    *   If there is at least one human, then the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is TRUE.\n    *   Humans always tell the truth, so any human in the village would say this statement.\n    *   Vampires always lie. If there is at least one human, and a vampire says \"At least one of us is a human,\" the vampire would be telling the truth. This contradicts the rule that vampires always lie.\n    *   Therefore, if there is at least one human in the village, no vampire could have made the statement \"At least one of us is a human.\" This would mean that every single resident who made the statement (all 100 of them) must be human. If all 100 residents are human, then there are no vampires. However, you explicitly saw a vampire, which creates a contradiction.\n\n2.  **Consider the possibility that there are no humans in the village (i.e., all residents are vampires).**\n    *   If all 100 residents are vampires, then the true situation is that there are 0 humans in the village.\n    *   In this scenario, the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is FALSE.\n    *   Vampires always lie, so they *must* make a false statement.\n    *   Therefore, if all 100 residents are vampires, they would all say \"At least one of us is a human\" because it is a false statement, consistent with them being vampires.\n    *   This scenario also aligns with your initial sighting of a vampire.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only consistent solution is that all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires.",

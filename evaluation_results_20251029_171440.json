      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u00c8\u203acu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "All 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\nLet S be the statement \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\n1.  **Consider if the statement S is true.**\n    *   If S is true, it means there is at least one human in the village.\n    *   Humans always tell the truth, so any human would say S.\n    *   Vampires always lie, so if S is true, any vampire would say \"not S\" (meaning \"All of us are vampires\" or \"None of us is human\").\n    *   However, the puzzle states that *everyone* in the village gives the *same* response: S. This creates a contradiction, as vampires would have to lie by saying \"not S\", not S itself. Therefore, the statement S cannot be true.\n\n2.  **Consider if the statement S is false.**\n    *   If S is false, it means \"None of us is human,\" which implies \"All of us are vampires.\"\n    *   Since all residents are vampires, they all lie.\n    *   If the truth is \"All of us are vampires\" (meaning S is false), then a vampire would lie by saying something that is false. The statement S (\"At least one of us is a human\") is indeed false in this scenario.\n    *   This is consistent: all 100 residents are vampires, they all lie, and they all make the false statement \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nBased on this, the only consistent scenario is that all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea are vampires.",

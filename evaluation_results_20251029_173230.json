      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u00c8\u203acu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "All 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the statement:** The statement everyone gave is, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n2.  **Consider the possibility of humans:** If there were any humans in the village, they would tell the truth. For a human to truthfully say, \"At least one of us is a human,\" there must indeed be at least one human present. If this were the case, then any vampires present would also say the same thing. However, vampires must lie. If a vampire says, \"At least one of us is a human,\" for it to be a lie, the opposite must be true: \"None of us are human\" (meaning all are vampires). This creates a contradiction if both humans and vampires are present and all give the same response.\n3.  **Consider the possibility of only vampires:** If all 100 residents are vampires, then every single resident must lie. The statement, \"At least one of us is a human,\" is factually false if everyone is a vampire. Therefore, when a vampire says this statement, they are indeed lying, which is consistent with their nature. Since everyone gives this same response, this scenario perfectly fits the conditions: 100 vampires, all lying, about there being at least one human.\n4.  **Initial observation:** The task explicitly states that \"a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village,\" confirming the presence of at least one vampire. This eliminates any scenario where there are no vampires.\n\nGiven these points, the only logical conclusion is that all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea are vampires.",

      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u00c8\u203acu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "There are 100 residents in the village of \u0218irnea. You have established with absolute certainty that there is at least one vampire among them, as you witnessed a vampire and know it must be a resident. Humans always tell the truth, and vampires always lie.\n\nEvery resident gives the same response to the question \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea?\": \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nLet's analyze this statement:\n\n1.  **If there were both humans and vampires in the village:**\n    *   Any human would state the truth, meaning \"At least one of us is a human\" would be true. This implies there is at least one human.\n    *   Any vampire would lie, meaning the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" would be false. If this statement is false, it means there are *no* humans in the village.\n    *   This creates a contradiction: A human's truthfulness requires at least one human, while a vampire's lie requires no humans. Therefore, this scenario (having both humans and vampires) is impossible.\n\n2.  **Since you know there is at least one vampire in the village**, the scenario where all residents are human (and thus there are no vampires) is ruled out.\n\n3.  **The only remaining possibility is that all residents are vampires.**\n    *   In this scenario, there are 100 vampires and 0 humans.\n    *   All vampires lie.\n    *   The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is objectively false, as there are no humans.\n    *   Since vampires lie, they would all respond by saying the false statement is true. Thus, all 100 vampires would say, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n    *   This scenario is entirely consistent with all the given information.\n\nTherefore, all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires.",

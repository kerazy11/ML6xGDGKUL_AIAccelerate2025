      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u00c8\u203acu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "Here's how to solve this riddle:\n\n*   **If there were 100 vampires and 0 humans:** They would all have to lie. If asked \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea?\", they would have to say something other than \"100\". But they all say \"At least one of us is a human.\" This is a lie, which is consistent with them being vampires, but it implies there's a human, which contradicts our assumption of 0 humans.\n\n*   **If there was 1 human and 99 vampires:** The human would tell the truth: \"At least one of us is a human.\" The 99 vampires would have to lie. If they were asked \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea?\", they would have to lie about there being 99 vampires. They could say \"At least one of us is a human.\" This is a lie (because there are 99 vampires and 1 human, so it's not true that *at least one of them* is human - it's true that *at least one of us* is human, which is what the human said). This scenario works!\n\n*   **If there were 2 humans and 98 vampires:** The humans would tell the truth: \"At least one of us is a human.\" The 98 vampires would have to lie. If asked \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea?\", they would have to lie about there being 98 vampires. They could say \"At least one of us is a human.\" This is a lie because there are 98 vampires and 2 humans, so it's not true that at least one of them is human.\n\n*   **If there were 3 humans and 97 vampires:** The humans would tell the truth: \"At least one of us is a human.\" The 97 vampires would have to lie. If asked \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea?\", they would have to lie about there being 97 vampires. They could say \"At least one of us is a human.\" This is a lie because there are 97 vampires and 3 humans, so it's not true that at least one of them is human.\n\nThis pattern continues up to 99 humans and 1 vampire.\n\n*   **If there were 100 humans and 0 vampires:** They would all tell the truth. If asked \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea?\", they would all say \"0\". This contradicts their actual statement of \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nThe only scenario that works is when **99** residents are vampires and **1** resident is human. The human truthfully states, \"At least one of us is a human.\" The 99 vampires must lie. If they were to say \"99 vampires,\" they would be telling the truth. Therefore, they must say something else. By saying \"At least one of us is a human,\" they are lying, as there is only one human in the village.",

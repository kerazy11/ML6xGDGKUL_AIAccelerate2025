      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u00c8\u203acu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u00c8\u02dcirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u00c8\u02dcirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "The villagers' collective response, \"At least one of us is a human,\" provides the key to unraveling the mystery. Let's analyze this statement based on the rules of the village: humans always tell the truth, and vampires always lie.\n\nConsider two possibilities:\n\n1.  **The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is true.**\n    If this statement is true, it means there is at least one human in the village. A human would truthfully utter this statement. However, if there are any vampires present, a vampire would *have to lie* and therefore would *not* say a true statement. Since everyone in the village said the same thing, this scenario would lead to a contradiction: the vampires would not say a true statement, yet everyone said it. Therefore, this possibility is false.\n\n2.  **The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is false.**\n    If this statement is false, it means its opposite is true: \"None of us is a human,\" or in other words, \"All of us are vampires.\" In this scenario, every resident is a vampire. Since vampires always lie, they would each lie about the true situation. If the truth is \"All of us are vampires\" (and thus \"None of us is a human\"), a vampire would lie and say \"At least one of us is a human.\" This perfectly aligns with everyone in the village giving the same response.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent conclusion is that the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is a lie, and consequently, all 100 residents of \u00c8\u02dcirnea have been turned into vampires.",
